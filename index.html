            <p>Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, 
                determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector.
                When multiple declarations have equal specificity,
                the last declaration found in the CSS is applied to the element. 
                Specificity only applies when the same element is targeted by multiple declarations.</p>
